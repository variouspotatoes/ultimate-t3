# Ultimate TicTacToe

This is based on the game of ultimate tic-tac-toe, where a typical tic-tac-toe board contains another tic-tac-toe board inside each square. Players play inside each small tic-tac-toe board. WHichever square a player picks will determine which of the sub-boards the next player will use. 
Once a player wins a sub-board, that square is considered that player's square, and is marked with an X or O.

A player wins once they are able to mark three squares in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.
